# Manual Tester Portfolio
## ABOUT ME :loudspeaker:
I am a Master of Science in Environmental Protection and Pharmaceutical Technician. I completed postgraduate studies in the field of Data Scientist. I took part in a Manual Tester training where, among other things,I practiced writing test cases and reporting bugs in JIRA. As part of the course, I performed retests and regression tests.
I am not afraid of challenges and I like learning new things. Currently, I focus on actively developing my frontend skills and manual testing. I am seeking my first professional opportunity in the IT field.
I will be taking the ISTQB exam in November.I am in the process of learning a test automation tool - Cypress.
